# Overview

There are many chips that can be used for storage. All are to be automotive grade, preferably aerospace grade This project will focus on the following 3:

## NAND Flash

On paper, the most desirable form of memory. It is non-volatile, high capacity, and cheaper. The downsides are the limited amount of write cycles - this could prove fatal in a mission critical environment

## NOR Flash

Similar to NOR flash but with much higher read/write speeds. Costs more

## eMMC

Very high capacity storage which acts very similar to an SD card. However, we might not need this much storaage so chips could be redundant
